# ECFusion
This is code of "ECFusion: Edge-guided Cross-scale Fusion Based on Generative Adversarial Learning for Multi-modal Medical Image Fusion"(TST'25)


Just prepared the data and the filefloders, and prepared the vgg pre-trained (it will be download when you python this train.py and test.py)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b00d472-c57f-4538-916a-dd08aaa354c4)

and then 
python the train.py and test.py.

and the prepared model is avaliable  at :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vW3w_jaiyMXNiahf_W-uGSA61i4oWkeg/view?usp=drive_link
